    <h1>Clean Temple Guide</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><em>A 7-day journey of health, holiness, and discipline — physically and spiritually.</em></p>

    <h2>Day 1 — Consecration Begins</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Before there’s transformation, there has to be separation. Consecration isn’t about perfection, it’s about posture — being available, being empty, being holy.
    </blockquote>
    <div class="discipline">
      <div class="section-title">Discipline</div>
      • Drink 16 oz of water upon waking<br>

    </div>
    <div class="prayer">
      <div class="section-title">Prayer</div>
      Father, I’m not asking You to clean my feed. Clean my heart. Remove what’s unlike You. Burn away what’s blocking You.

      What have I been letting in that G‑D wants to remove?
    </div>

    <h2>Day 2 — Fuel & Fire</h2>
    <blockquote>
      G‑D doesn’t just want a willing spirit — He wants a strong body too. This is stewardship. This is worship.
    </blockquote>

      What have I been using to fill myself that G‑D never gave me?

    <h2>Day 3 — Mind Renewal</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Pastor Jason always says: “You can’t keep letting trash run through your mind and expect to think holy.” Today, we clean the lens.

      What thought has been holding me hostage?

    <h2>Day 4 — Focus & Fire</h2>
    <blockquote>
      A distracted life is a defeated life. Pastor Javen said, “What you focus on grows. What you ignore dies.” Choose what lives today.

      Where has my energy been going that’s not Kingdom?

    <h2>Day 5 — Clean Spirit</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Purity is power. G‑D won’t flow freely through a polluted spirit. Today, clear the channel.
    </blockquote>
    <div class="discipline">

      What spiritual noise have I accepted as normal?
    </div>

    <h2>Day 6 — Community & Conviction</h2>
    <blockquote>
      The right people don’t just inspire you — they refine you. Who you run with determines how you run.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Day 7 — Strength in Surrender</h2>
    <blockquote>
      Pastor Jason said: “You don’t need more motivation, you need more surrender.” You want strength? Let go.

<h2>Covering, Community & Calling</h2>
<p>
        <strong>When I’m at home — Hope FLA Church</strong><br>
        690 E State Rte 50 #200, Clermont, FL 34711 (Upstairs of the BOA)<br>
        Under the leadership of Pastor Jason Ramdial, Hope FLA has been the place where my roots run deep. 
        This is the house that taught me the reality of deliverance, holiness, spiritual discipline, and the fear of the Lord. 
        Pastor Jason’s no-compromise preaching and prophetic boldness built in me a reverence for G‑D that transformed my walk.
        It’s more than a church — it’s where I learned how to stand, how to war in prayer, and how to walk with power and purity. 
        My foundation was poured here, and I carry it with me wherever I go.
      </p><p>
        <strong>Tsavah</strong><br>
        Tsavah is more than a ministry — it’s a movement of young people with hearts set on fire for the Lord. 
        It’s the most powerful youth group I’ve ever been a part of — rooted in worship, boldness, repentance, and the presence of G‑D. 
        We don’t gather just to have fun; we gather to go deep, to grow together, and to carry the fire wherever we go. 
        Whether it’s Friday nights worship at the altar or monthly competitions, Tsavah is where consecration becomes contagious. I’ve been honored to be part of this move of G‑D since the tail end of 2022, and I’ve watched Him work through this ministry in ways that mark people forever. Led by our incredible youth pastor Romar, Tsavah continues to transform and raise up a generation that's not afraid to be set apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through <strong>Tsavah Music</strong>, our sound reflects our pursuit — raw, hungry, and Holy Spirit led. 
        And every year, <strong>Tsavah Storm</strong> brings a week of revival, warfare, breakthrough, and marking encounters with G‑D. 
        It’s not just a camp — it’s a proving ground where leaders are born, chains break, and Heaven meets Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>While I’m at college — NOW Church</strong><br>
        3600 College Ave, Davie, FL 33314 (Nova High Auditorium)<br>
        NOW Church is my spiritual covering while I’m studying in South Florida. 
        Under the leadership of Pastor Javen, this house is a hub for bold faith, unapologetic truth, and real love. 
        The message at NOW is always urgent — it's about walking in the authority G‑D gave us and refusing to stay asleep.
        Pastor Javen challenges the body to move, to build, and to activate what's already inside of us through the Word and the Spirit.
        At NOW, we don't just hear the Word — we apply it, live it, and carry it into every space we're called to influence.
      </p>

      
      
      <p>
        <strong>Young Adults (YA) IMPACT</strong><br>
        IMPACT isn’t just a ministry — I knew from the beginning it was the assignment G‑D placed on my life. 
        I was the first to attend, sitting in that very first meeting with only Pedro, Alysha, and myself. 
        From that small beginning, I’ve watched G‑D grow it into a thriving movement of over 80 young adults pursuing Him boldly. 
        I’m proud to serve on the leadership team alongside my peers as we carry the fire of revival across South Florida. 
        Our mission is simple: wake people up spiritually, call them higher, and create a space where G‑D moves through bold obedience and real discipleship. 
        We believe in people impacting people — with Jesus at the center of it all.
        As a team, we organize outreach, disciple others, and boldly speak truth in love. 
        It’s a space where G‑D consistently stretches and uses each of us — and I’m honored to play my part in what He’s doing through YA IMPACT.
